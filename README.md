# Pacman
This is a group project for fundamentals of Computer Networks at Indiana University Southeast. Rory Stiff & Cheyenne Pierpont
Project Outline: 
  
Our Project proposal is to make a network gamed connected through two laptops. Is a
multiplayer Pacman game. This is based off the Pac-Man Party Royale where there could be
between 2-4 players. Competition Battle mode Is what we would be basing off for this game so
there would be the normal little Pac-dots. But instead of just trying to get and eat the Pac-dots
before the timer runs out you are going to try and eat the other Pac-man. The other player will be
doing the same trying to eat the Pac-dots and eat the other Pac-man player.
Another thing we would try to implement into the game is inside the Pac-Dots adding in
power ups. These power ups would make the Pac-man run faster and there would be one more
power up. The Super Pellet you would race against the other Pac-man player and after you
acquire the Super Pellet. You would watch the ghost, and the other Pac-man player run from you
because you donâ€™t know exactly what power up you could get.


Updated Project Status report:
- Ensure that everyone has a device Player one should have a laptop, Player two
should have a labtop. Both people need to open a link to a browser: coming soon.
One player will be a Pacman the other will be a ghost. Once player one has made
it into the browser they will have the game id. It needs to be given out to who
wants to play. If more than one player tries to join, they will be prompted to wait
because the game room is full.
- One person will be assigned the Pacman the other will be the ghost. The player
being the ghost is going to chase player 2 the Pac man. Pac man is trying to eat
all the dots. If Pac man eats all the dots before the ghost eats him, he wins. If the
ghost eats Pacman before he gets the dots, then the ghost wins.
