# Pacman
This is a group project for fundamentals of Computer Networks at Indiana University Southeast. Rory Stiff & Cheyenne Pierpont

Project Outline: Our Project for fall 2024 was we made a network gamed connected through two laptops. Is a multiplayer Pacman game. This is based off the Pac-Man Party Royale where there could be
between 2-4 players. Competition Battle mode Is what we would be basing off for this game so
there would be the normal little Pac-dots. The other player will be doing the same trying to eat the Pac-dots and not be eaten by the ghost. If a player is eaten by a ghost they will be redirected to the menu button. We ended up not adding in power ups and being a ghost because we ran out of time. 

  

Updated Project Status report:
